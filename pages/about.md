## Background

I'm a Belfast-born, Dublin-based journalist with a grá for bringing peoples' stories to life. My beat is currently health and features, and I've previously covered environment, politics and rural affairs. 

My favourite part of the job? Working with the people who generously let me into their worlds, and gaining their trust. 

Sometimes I am asked to give my opinion on the latest developments in the arena of news and politics. This is another element of my job which I love. I have contributed to local and national radio stations in Ireland and UK, shared my perspective with national broadcasters, delivered keynotes speeches (including a TEDx talk) and participated in many a panel discussion.


## Availability

I'm open to writing and speaking opportunities. Please don't hesitate to get in touch.
