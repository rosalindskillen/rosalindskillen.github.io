## Background

I'm a Belfast-born, Dublin-based journalist with a grá for bringing peoples' stories to life. My beat is currently health and features, and I've previously covered environment, politics and rural affairs. I love reporting on a topic that I can really sink my teeth into, and I'm constantly looking for the human interest angle in every story. 

My favourite part of the job? Working with the people who generously let me into their worlds, and gaining their trust. I'm interested in telling the stories that often go overlooked and giving a voice to those at the margins of society. 

Sometimes I am asked to give my opinion on the latest developments in the arena of news and politics. This is another element of my job which I love. I have contributed to local and national radio stations in Ireland and UK, shared my perspective with national broadcasters (like the BBC), delivered keynotes speeches (including a TEDx talk) and participated in many a panel discussion or fiery debate. Evidently, I love to talk as much as I love to write.
